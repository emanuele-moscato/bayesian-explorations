    "#### Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose an ion has to traverse a medium (homogeneous or inhomogeneous), starting at some point with some initial velocity and moving in 2 dimensions, the $(z, y)$ plane, where $z$ is the transverse direction w.r.t. the medium. The particle \"goes forward\" along the $z$ axis and \"goes up or down\" along the $y$ axis. The medium extends in $[z_I, z_F]$ in the $z$ direction and indefinitely in the $y$ direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume we can measure the $y$ coordinate of the particles in $z_I$ and $z_F$, with $y_I = y(z_I)$ and $y_F = y(z_F)$ and the corresponding velocity vectors $\\mathbf{v}_I = \\mathbf{v}(z_I)$ and $\\mathbf{v}_F = \\mathbf{v}(z_F)$, with $\\mathbf{v} \\equiv \\left(\\begin{array}{c} v_z \\\\ v_y \\end{array}\\right)$. We also assume the medium is homogeneous in the $y$ direction so that the inhomogeneity (if any) only happens as the ion moves forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Coordinate system\n",
    "\n",
    "We parametrize the trajectory $\\mathbf{s} \\equiv \\left(\\begin{array}{c} z \\\\ y \\end{array}\\right)$ as a function of $z$ itself (rather than time), which we discretize into an evenly-spaced grid $z_0 \\equiv z_I, z_1, z_2, \\ldots, z_{N-1}, z_N \\equiv z_F$ so that the problem boils down to finding the function $y(z)$, i.e. the sequence $y_1 = y(z_1), \\ldots, y_{N-1} = y(z_{N-1})$ (we already know $y_0 \\equiv y_I$ and $y_N \\equiv y_F$).\n",
    "\n",
    "We define $\\theta\\in[-\\pi, \\pi]$ to be the angle between $\\mathbf{v}$ and the $z$ axis (the range of $\\theta$ has been chosen to conform to the convention often used for angular probability distributions).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "We usa a simple model for the dynamics of the ion traversing the medium:\n",
    "- At each $z$, the ion interacts with the medium with some probability, which we assume to be Bernoulli with some probability parameter $p$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(\\mathrm{interaction} | z) = \\mathrm{Ber}( x = 1 | p(z)),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $x$ is a label indicating if the interaction takes place ($x=1$) or not ($x=0$). We assume the parameter $p$ is in a function of $z$, with the idea that more \"dense\" regions of the medium give a higher probaibility of interaction (bigger $p$) while less dense regions give a lower probability (smaller $p$). If we assume the medium is homogeneous, then $p$ is a constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If an interaction takes place, we assume the angle $\\theta$ varies as $\\theta \\to \\theta + \\delta\\theta$, where\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(\\delta\\theta | z) = f(\\delta\\theta | \\mu = 0, \\kappa(z)) \\equiv \\frac{\\exp\\left( \\kappa \\cos(\\delta\\theta - \\mu) \\right)}{2\\pi I_0(\\kappa)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "is the von Mises distribution with parameters $\\mu\\in\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\kappa \\in (0, +\\infty)$ (a sort of angular version of a Gaussian), $I_0(\\kappa)$ being the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order $\\kappa$. The distribution is symmetric around its $\\mu$, which also sets its maximum, and $\\kappa$ parametrizes its variance, and is conveniently implemented in as the `VonMises` distribution in Tensorflow Probability, with parameters `loc`$\\equiv \\mu$ and `concentration`$\\equiv\\kappa$. In the general case of inhomogeneous media, we assume $\\kappa = \\kappa(z)$ to reflect that some regions can deflect the with bigger angles than others. We assume no preferred direction for the deviation, so we keep $\\mu = 0$. In the case of an homogeneous medium, $\\kappa$ becomes a constant as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ion travels in a straight line depending on its velocity if no interaction takes place.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**\n",
    "- If we parametrize $y$ as a function of $z$, work with a grid (1-dimensional lattice) of $z$ values **and** impose that at every evolution step $z$ increases of one lattice space $\\Delta$, irrespective of $v_z$, we are in fact using a discretized time with **non-constant spacing**. Meaning: we update the system (and check if an interaction happens) every time $z$ increases by $\\Delta$, but the physical time the system takes to undergo such evolution vaies.\n",
    "- The above time depends on $v_z$ as $\\Delta t = \\Delta / v_z$.\n",
    "- This way of doing things is a simplification and **doesn't** cater for the cases in which the ion is scattered backwards by the medium ($|\\delta\\theta| > \\pi/2$).\n",
    "- A better way of doing things would be to have discrete time and impose some probability of interaction at each time step (maybe as a Poisson point process, in which the probability of a given time inteval between two subsequent interactions follows an exponential distribution)."
